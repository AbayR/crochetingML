GAUGE SWATCH
NOTES
• The success of this project depends on getting correct row gauge. It is
recommended to do a gauge swatch in pattern to ensure you are achieving
the stated row gauge of 6 rows in pattern.
• More than 6 rows in pattern will result in a Cardigan with a larger finished
chest measurement. Less than 6 rows in pattern will result in a Cardigan with a
smaller chest measurement.
Make a Granny Square swatch as follows: See Diagram and Image on page 5.

SEW SHOULDER SEAMS
Thread yarn needle with length of yarn approx twice the length of top of Sleeve.
With Right Side (RS) facing, align stitches along top of Sleeve. Working through both
the front and back of Sleeve, join yarn through corner ch-2 sp of front of Sleeve
and corresponding corner ch-2 sp of back of Sleeve. Insert needle through top of
next dc at front and corresponding dc at back. Pull yarn through to join.
Keep a nice, relaxed tension on the sewing yarn making sure
not to pull too tightly as this will cause the seam to pucker.
Continue (Cont) in this manner, inserting needle through
corresponding sts and ch-1 sps at front and back of Sleeve, to
end of shoulder seam. Work through last corner ch-2 sp and
fasten off, leaving a length to weave in end.
Weave in end by inserting needle down through stitches and
through bottom loops of dc on WS of work.
CENTER BACK SEAM
Align left and right sides at center back.
Thread yarn needle with length of yarn approximately 2 times length of back seam
and join sides together through both top corner ch-2 sps. (Note: These will be the
same ch-2 sps on either side where shoulder seam was worked).
Sew center back seam using whipstitch
as for Shoulder. Fasten off at bottom
ch-2 sp.

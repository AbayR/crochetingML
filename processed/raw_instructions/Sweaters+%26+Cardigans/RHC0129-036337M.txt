Fold into Shape
Fold Hexagon as shown in diagram,
to create upside down L shape:
Measure from Center Back to side as shown in
diagram: 10½ (12-14½-16½)" [26.5 (30.5-37-42)
cm]. If you need to work another round to achieve
the correct measurement for your size, do so now,
before seaming.
Sew Shoulder Seams
Thread yarn needle with length of yarn approx twice the length of top of Sleeve.
With Right Side (RS) facing, align stitches along top of Sleeve. Working through both
the front and back of Sleeve, join yarn through corner ch-2 sp of front of Sleeve and
corresponding corner ch-2 sp of back of Sleeve. Insert needle through top of next
dc at front and corresponding dc at back. Pull yarn through to join.
Keep a nice, relaxed tension on the sewing yarn making sure not to pull too tightly
as this will cause the seam to pucker. Continue (Cont) in this manner, inserting
needle through correspond ing sts C RaOnCdH EcTh | S-K1I LsL pLEsV EaLt: B fErGoINnNtE aRnd back of Sleeve, to end
of shoulder seam. Work through last corner ch-2 sp and fasten off, leaving a length

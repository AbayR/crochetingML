Step 1 - Make a Granny Gauge swatch as follows:
GRANNY GAUGE SWATCH
See Diagram on page 5.

form ring.
1st round (rnd): Ch 6. [3 double crochet (dc) in ring. Ch 3] 3 times. 2 dc in ring.
Join with sl st to 3rd ch of beginning (beg) ch 6.
2nd rnd: Sl st in ch-3 space (sp). Ch 6. 3 dc in same ch-3 sp. *Ch 1. (3 dc. Ch 3. 3 dc)
in next ch-3 sp. Rep from * twice more. Ch 1. 2 dc in first ch-3 sp. Join with sl st to

Lay Granny Gauge Swatch flat and measure from the center of square (see photo)
to top of last round. These 6 rounds should measure 4" [10 cm].
If it is slightly less than 4" [10 cm], giving the square a bit of a tug to ‘open up’ the
stitches may help to achieve gauge.
If it measures 3½" [9 cm] or less, go up a hook size or 2 and work another gauge
swatch. If these 6 rounds measure more than 4" [10 cm], you may choose to go
down a hook size. Be sure to work another swatch if necessary to make sure you
are achieving 6 rnds = 4" [10 cm].

SEW SHOULDER SEAMS
Note: Sample shown in pictures below uses different color yarn for seaming so
that it is easier to follow along. When seaming, use same color yarn as garment to
create a nearly invisible seam.
Thread yarn needle with length of D approx twice the length of top of Sleeve.
Sew shoulder seam using Whipstitch as
follows: With RS facing, align stitches along
top of Sleeve. Working through both front and
back of Sleeve, join yarn through corner ch-2
sp of front and corresponding corner ch-2 sp
of back.
Insert needle through top of next dc
at front and corresponding dc at back.
Pull yarn through to join. Keep a nice,
relaxed tension on the sewing yarn
making sure not to pull too tightly as
this will cause the seam to pucker.
Continue in this manner, inserting needle
through corresponding sts and ch-1 sps
at front and back of Sleeve, until end of
shoulder seam.

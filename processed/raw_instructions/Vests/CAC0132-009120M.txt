GAUGE
In pattern, 6 pattern repeats = 6"/15cm
and 5 rows = 2 3/4"/7cm, using smaller
hook. Notes: One pattern repeat
consists of one ch-5 sp and one sc.
The gauge given is as "crocheted". As
work progresses and when garment is
blocked (if desired) and worn, the
gauge becomes closer to 4 pattern
repeats = 5"/12.5cm.
STITCHES USED
Chain (ch), single crochet (sc), slip stitch (sl st), treble crochet (tr)
SPECIAL STITCHES
Fsc: Foundation single crochet (This technique creates a foundation
chain and a row of single crochet stitches in one) –
Step 1:Place a slip knot on hook, ch 2, insert hook in 2nd ch from hook
and draw up a loop; yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the
"chain"); yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook (the "single
crochet").
Step 2:Insert hook into the "chain" of the previous stitch and draw up a
loop, yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the "chain"), yarn
over and draw through 2 loops on hook (the "single crochet"). Repeat
for the length of foundation.
rev sc: Reverse single crochet—Work single crochet in opposite
direction by inserting hook in next stitch (to the right if right-handed,
and to the left if left-handed), yarn over and draw up a loop, yarn over
and draw through both loops on hook.
NOTE
Vest is worked in one piece from lower edge up to underarm. The piece
is divided for armholes. The back and fronts are then worked
separately up to shoulders.

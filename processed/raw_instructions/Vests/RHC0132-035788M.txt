• Motifs begin with Color 1 (shortest
color rep) from center of pull-skein,
leaving a 4" [10 cm] tail to weave in.
• Each color aligns with 1 rnd in the
Motif with 5 colors in total. If too
much color is left at end of rnd, pull
back some sts and slightly loosen
gauge to re-work sts and finish at
color change. If too little color is
left, pull back some sts and slightly
tighten gauge to re-work sts and
finish at color change.
• When Motif is complete, cut yarn
where Color 5 (longest color rep)
ends leaving a tail for weaving in.

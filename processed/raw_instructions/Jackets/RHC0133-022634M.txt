1979 2011
When this pattern was first published in 1979, it was one of a collection of patterns for larger sizes
—a new idea for that time. We have included sizes from small to 2X for this warm jacket.
Directions are for size Small; changes for sizes GAUGE: 12 dc = 4”; 7 rows = 4”. CHECK YOUR GAUGE.
Medium, Large, X-Large and 2X are in parentheses. Use any size hook to obtain the gauge given.
Finished Bust: 36½ (38½, 40½, 46½, 55½)” NOTE: Jacket is worked from Neck edge down to lower
Finished Length: 27½ (27½, 27½, 28½, 29)” edge. Sleeves are worked from armhole down to cuff.

Step 1:Place a slip knot on hook, ch 3,
yarn over, insert hook in 3rd ch from hook
and draw up a loop; yarn over and draw
through one loop on hook (the "chain");
yarn over and draw through 3 loops on
hook (the "half double crochet").
Step 2:Yarn over, insert hook into the
"chain" of the previous stitch and draw up a
loop, yarn over and draw through one loop
on hook (the "chain"), yarn over and draw
through 3 loops on hook (the "half double
crochet"). Repeat step 2 for the length of
foundation.
First-dc: First double crochet in a row
(instead of a traditional ch 3)—Ch 1, sc in
first st, ch 2. Note: If preferred, you may
work a traditional ch-3 turning ch to serve
as the first dc in a row.
First-tr: First treble crochet in a row (instead of a traditional ch 4)—Ch 1,
sc in first st, ch 3. Note: If preferred, you may work a traditional ch-4 turning
ch to serve as the first tr in a row.

NOTE
Diamond Lace stretches and opens up when blocked and worn. Take care
to stretch fabric gently when measuring, to simulate the blocked lace. This
is particularly important when measuring sleeves. Sleeves tend to stretch

4"/7.5-10cm cuff (to be folded back). If no cuff is desired, work each sleeve
until it measures about 3-4"/7.5-10cm less than the measurements given.

single crochet (sc), slip stitch (sl st)
SPECIAL TERMS
dsst: Double slip stitch—Insert hook
in same dc (dc that was just worked
into), yarn over and draw up a loop;
insert hook into next dc, yarn over
and draw loop through dc and
through the 2 loops on hook.
BPdc: Back-post double crochet—
Yarn over, insert hook from back to
front and then to back again around
post of stitch, yarn over and draw up
loop, complete as dc.

NOTES
1. V-Topper is made in one piece from lower back edge, up over
shoulders and down to lower front edge.
2. When work reaches armhole, sleeve chains are added to each end
of row to form base of sleeves.
3. When work reaches neck, stitches are left unworked for back neck,
and the fronts are worked separately until neck is shaped. Then work
continues in one piece down to lower front edge.
4. Dc rows are worked in the back loops only. For added stability,
work the first and last st in both loops.
